# Virutal-filesystem
Uni assignment virtual file system. A virtual file system that allows user's to read, write, delete, rename, create &amp; rewrite files. The file system comprised of a directory table and the filedata. The directory table contains records of the files (each 72 bytes long) and stores the names (64 bytes), offset (4 bytes) and length (4 bytes). The file data contains the physical contents of each file using blocks 256 bytes long, there are 2^24 bytes in the total file system. Furthermore a merkle hash tree was implemented using all the blocks as the leaves of the tree. Fletcher hashing function was used to produce the hash codes for each node.
